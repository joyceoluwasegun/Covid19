# COVID-19 Dataset Analysis and Visualization

This repository contains a dataset scraped from [Worldometer - COVID-19 Statistics](https://www.worldometers.info/coronavirus/#countries). The dataset was analyzed through Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to derive key insights and conclusions. Additionally, the dataset was visualized using Power BI to provide a comprehensive overview of the COVID-19 situation worldwide.

## Dataset Source

The dataset was collected by scraping data from Worldometer, a reliable source for COVID-19 statistics, and it includes various metrics related to COVID-19 cases, recoveries, deaths, population, and other relevant information.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA process involved various analyses and conclusions:

- Overview of the dataset structure and contents.
- Statistical summaries and distributions of COVID-19 metrics.
- Identification of trends, patterns, and correlations among different variables.
- Derivation of vital conclusions and insights from the data.

## Visualization with Power BI

Visualization of the dataset was carried out using Power BI to present the following insights:

- Population statistics.
- Total COVID-19 cases globally.
- Updates on COVID-19 cases over time.
- Top 5 countries affected by COVID-19.
- Total recoveries and deaths.
- Map visualizations displaying affected countries and continents along with their respective figures.

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/joyceoluwasegun/covid19-data-analysis.git
    ```
2. Explore the dataset and the EDA findings in the provided Jupyter Notebook or analysis files.
3. To view the Power BI visualization, download and open the Power BI file (`covid19_visualization.pbix`) in your Power BI Desktop application.

Feel free to dive into the EDA findings and visualizations, and adapt the analyses for further insights or improvements.
